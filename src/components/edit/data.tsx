Delivery is only available to qualifying postcodes within a 5 mile radius of our premises which are at 33 Woodford Avenue, Gants Hill, GU111BH. All online customers whose postcodes lie within our delivery area are given the choice of 'Home Delivery' or 'Customer to Collect' when confirming their order in the checkout. Customers whose postcodes lie outside of our delivery area MUST COLLECT THEIR ORDER. We aim to have home delivery orders delivered within 40min - 1hr of the customer placing an order (depending on distance, time of day and the size of the order) and we can have collection orders ready to collect within 30min. Please select the time you would like your order on the Order Confirmation page when you checkout. During busy periods times may vary, if there is a significant delay, where possible, we will contact you. All orders below the minimum order value* must be collected.",
